      <hr />
      <p>Hi! I'm Ashley. I have been tutoring for over 5 years and have experience working with students of all ages and
        abilities, from preschoolers to professionals. I have tutored students studying English as a second language, as
        well as students with dyslexia, ADHD, autism, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia. I work to create a positive learning
        environment where my students can sharpen their strengths while improving any weaker areas.</p>

      <p><strong>Orton-Gillingham: </strong>I have been tutoring Orton-Gillingham for over 3 years and am working
        towards my certification. I specialize in reading and spelling for students with dyslexia. By applying the
        Orton-Gillingham reading and spelling method, I have helped several students improve their reading and spelling
        skills, as well as comprehension.
        <!--I am also a co-author of Learn to Decode's Orton-Gillingham based reading and spelling materials and exercises, based directly off of <i>The Gillingham Manual</i> by Anna Gillingham and Bessie Stillman-->
      </p>

      <p><strong>English: </strong> <i>ELA, Grammar, Writing, and Reading Comprehension.</i> I've been teaching Language
        Arts, Grammar, Writing, and Reading skills for over five years. As a 96th percentile scorer on the SAT Reading
        and Writing exams, I am well versed in comprehension strategies, grammar rules, and writing conventions. I'm
        happy to focus on one specific area (i.e. reading comprehension, grammar rules, writing skills, etc.) or teach
        general English Language skills depending on your tutoring needs.</p>

      <p><strong>ESL / Accent Reduction:</strong> I am a native American-English speaker with a strong background in
        English grammar and pronunciation. As a foreign language student, I understand common pronunciation errors made
        by ESL students, and exercises for gaining a natural American accent. I love learning about the history of
        languages and studying them. I currently study Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and American Sign Language
        (ASL), as well as effective strategies to learn new languages.</p>

      <p><strong>Coding and Computer Skills:</strong> I started coding in 2014. I am proficient in HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, and am also experienced with GitHub and web hosting. In sophomore year of high school,
        I built and managed a website, running on Bootstrap's framework, for a non-profit sports organization. I've
        continued building websites since then <!--(including this one!)--> and am constantly working to update and grow
        my skillset. I teach front-end web development as well as JavaScript, jQuery, and basic Python skills, including
        basic JS game development. I'm always happy to adapt curriculum to each individual student and have lesson plans
        for various ages and skill levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Math: </strong> I was a straight-A math student in high school and studied Algebra I, Algebra
        II/College Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, and Pre-Calculus. I work to make math lessons interactive, using
        visual aids, real-life examples, and activities to convey concepts to K-12 students. Having worked with several
        math students of different ages and abilities, including students with dyscalculia, I am better able to adapt
        the curriculum and tailor lessons to each student.</p>
      <p><strong>Executive Functioning Skills: </strong> I've been studying Executive Functioning skills and education
        psychology since 2015 and have tutored executive functioning skills for over 3 years. Executive Functioning
        sessions include organization, planning, persistence, flexibility, sustained attention, working memory, impulse
        control, time management, and initiative skills.</p>

      <p>Please contact me with any questions. I'd be happy to work with you!</p>
